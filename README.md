COUNTER APP PROJECT #2 - THIS TIME THE COUNTER APP JS CODE BUILT COMPLETELY FROM TESTING IN JEST

- Tests can be run with with:
`npm test`
- App can be launched in the Android EXPO App with 
`npm start` 
then scan the QR code to view it on a mobile.

I wanted to follow on from the simple counter app I made in Javascript/HTML/CSS, this time with it being built with fully tested counter code.

I found a tutorial that used Jest testing to build the code but launched the app using React Native & the EXPO App so that it could be viewed & interacted with on a Mobile & see real-time updates in the App.

`It was great to start building something using the RED, GREEN & REFACTOR cycle again & satisfying to see each stage build up using the error reports to incrementally grow the code with this tutorial leaving space for you to have to make some of your own decisions as to what to add to the code`

`Also rewarding to be faced with a variety of technical issues & new technologies such as React Native & the EXPO app and over-come those technical challenges with research & changing elements within the package.json file or by downloading & updating the necessary packages`
